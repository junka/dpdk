Just for fun.

Compile and run dpdk on macOS Darwin.

To minimize the work, we should disable those drivers which macOS does not have.
```
meson setup -Ddisable_drivers=common/*,dma/*,event/*,baseband/*,crypto/*,raw/*,bus/ifpga,net/ark,net/liquidio,net/failsafe,net/fm10k,net/gve,net/hinic,net/i40e,net/igc,net/ionic,net/ice,net/ixgbe,net/atlantic,net/bnx2x,net/bnxt,net/cxgbe,net/ena,net/enic,net/ngbe,net/null,net/octeon_ep,net/qede,bus/pci,net/e1000,net/bonding,bus/auxiliary -Ddisable_libs=telemetry,ipsec,security,distributor,jobstats,latencystats,lpm,graph,kni,gpudev,bitratestats,efd,stack,table,acl,reorder,port,node,rib,compressdev,regexdev,rawdev,bbdev,pcapng,fib,eventdev,hash,dmadev -Ddisable_apps=test-eventdev,test-cmdline,test-compress-perf,test-crypto-perf,test-flow-perf,test-gpudev,test-pipeline,test-regex,test-sad,test-acl,test-security-perf,test-bbdev,test-fib,test-mldev -Dtests=false
ninja
```

For now it pass the compilation. Only library and drivers below are enabled. And pci bus did not really work.

Luckily or not, I got an intel Mac, like freebsd, it always uses legacy memory model

Future work:
initial testpmd with pcap
2M hugepage
make vhost available so we can setup a qemu with dpdk vhostuserclient.
enable some basic test for traffic
